# Third Person Shooter Game
### This game powered up by Unreal Engine 4. :rocket:

***Scenario***: In this project, the player is in the role of a shooter, has encountered a series of enemies and must defeat them. The enemies in this game have artificial intelligence and will shoot at the player; If the player is shot too much and his health bar runs out, he will be killed and lose the game, but if the player can destroy the enemies first, he will win the game.

In this project, I try to implement the following components:
1. Designing the movements of game characters
2. Designing the necessary animations
3. Design of shooting components (audio and visual effects of shooting, aiming)
4. Determining and displaying the health of the characters and how they are killed
5. Artificial intelligence design for enemy characters
6. Determining the player's winning and losing conditions

You can see the gameplay below but for better experience and to hear the sounds, i recommend to see the full gameplay video in [this link](https://shorturl.at/iEITU).
